# Problem Statement

This project provides insights on how to leverage ‘Buy-Online Pickup-in-Store’ data to understand customer preferences, demand patterns and when products go out-of-stock (OOS) to improve replenishment decisions for grocery chains. The motivation for this project is to reduce lost sales opportunities by improving on-shelf availability (OSA), subsequently improving the overall revenue and profitability of the retail store.
